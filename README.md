PROJECT OVERVIEWâœŒ
Electronic clocks have predominately replaced the mechanical clocks. They aremuch reliable, accurate, maintenance free and portable. The digital clock wasdesign in order to enhance the
studentâ€Ÿs knowledge on team work, circuit designusing softwareâ€Ÿs, circuit building using bread board and implementation of the
circuit on PCB. This was made through contributions from all the groupmembers. Each and every member contributed to his best ability to ensure thatthe digital clock is being created.The project describes the construction of a quartz-crystal-controlled electronicdigital clock with an alarm capability. The clock is unique in design in the sensethat it can be assembled with various discrete devices, and is not based on asingle module. This will aid in easy troubleshooting of individual componentsand just replacing the faulty ones instead of discarding the entire module ifsomething is wrong.The microcontroller chip used in the circuit offers a number of special featuresfor example, Seconds, minutes, hours display, battery backup and alarm. All thecomponents used in the digital clock are widely available.In this project, the main circuit is connected by wires to the display circuit whichhas been built on an acrylic board. LCD is used for the display panel. After thecircuit is wired, it is to be checked thoroughly for proper connections and polarities. The circuit will then be ready for use.ðŸ˜Š
